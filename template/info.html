In general, transcription tools use a combination of speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to convert audio or video files into written transcripts. These tools typically use machine learning algorithms to analyze audio features and generate text output.

One common approach is to use deep neural networks, which are a type of machine learning algorithm that can learn from large amounts of data to recognize patterns and make predictions. In the case of transcription, these networks are trained on large datasets of audio and text data to learn how to recognize spoken words and transcribe them accurately.

Additionally, NLP algorithms are used to improve the accuracy of the transcription. These algorithms analyze the structure and context of the text to identify and correct errors, and to improve the overall readability of the transcript.
